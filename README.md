# Covid Wait (I can't think of a better name)

## Problem

The need for social distancing to combat COVID-19 has increased the difficulty of grocery shopping. Often, stores adhering to proper social distancing guidelines will have long wait times, or stores may neglect safe COVID-19 practices entirely. To stay as safe as possible, it's best to shop somewhere that respects social distancing with smaller crowds, to reduce exposure risk. However, these locations can be difficult to determine, and can often change.

## Solution

We aim to create an application that allows people to find the best locations to shop for groceries at a given time, based on their location.

### Possible/Planned Features

* Find a list of grocery stores from the user's (given) location
* View how busy a location currently is using Google Maps API
* Use Google Maps API historical data/estimates to tell user if it's better to go later
* User voting on locations on how well they have safety guildlines implemented
* Rank the nearby grocery stores based on above data
